# Alzheimer-s disease detection using Deep Learning
This project is an image classification model built using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to classify images into four different categories based on MRI dataset. This project demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline for image classification using CNNs, from dataset handling to model evaluation and visualization with 98.52% accuracy.

# Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. Early detection can help in better management and treatment planning. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to detect Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI scans.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of MRI scans categorized into different stages of Alzheimer’s:
1. Mild Demented
2. Moderate Demented
3. Non Demented
4. Very Mild Demented
The dataset is preprocessed and used to train deep learning models for classification.

# Project WorkflowThe project follows these key steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Image resizing and normalization.
Splitting dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing the dataset distribution.

3. Model Selection and Training:
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction.
Training the model with labeled MRI scans.

4. Evaluation and Testing:
Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Deployment (Optional):
Deploying the trained model for real-world inference.

# Model Architecture
The project primarily uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification. The architecture includes:
Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
Fully connected layers for classification.
Softmax activation for final predictions.

# Results
The trained model is evaluated using standard metrics:
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
Precision & Recall: Assesses the balance between false positives and false negatives.
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of classification performance.

# How to Use
1. PrerequisitesPython 3.x
2. TensorFlow/Keras
3. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
4. OpenCV (optional for image preprocessing)

# Future Improvements
1. Enhancing model accuracy with transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG16, EfficientNet).
2. Deploying the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
3. Increasing dataset size for better generalization.

# Conclusion
This project provides an efficient approach to detecting Alzheimer’s disease using deep learning. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using AI for medical image classification, offering potential real-world applications in healthcare.
