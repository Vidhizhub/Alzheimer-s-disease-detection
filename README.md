# Alzheimer-s disease detection using Deep Learning
This project is an image classification model built using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to classify images into four different categories based on MRI dataset. This project demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline for image classification using CNNs, from dataset handling to model evaluation and visualization with 98.52% accuracy.
